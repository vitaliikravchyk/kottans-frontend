## Task 1 --> Linux CLI, and HTTP
Now i'm done second task about Linux CLI and HTTP.
It was very useful for me i learned simple but powerful commands that help me to work with Command Line.
What about HTTP it's was interesting to learn how it work , about cache, transfering , methods and more else.
Quote which stayed in my head is: 

#### "HTTP is an application layer protocol over TCP, which is over IP."
